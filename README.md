# NTable: A Dataset for Camera-based Table Detection 

</div>

Most of the existing table detection methods are designed for scanned document images or Portable Document Format (PDF). And tables in the real world are seldom collected in the current mainstream table detection datasets. Therefore, we construct a dataset named NTable for camerabased table detection. NTable consists of a smaller-scale dateset NTable-ori, an augmented dataset NTable-cam, and a generated dataset NTable-gen. More details are available in our paper "NTable: A Dataset for Camera-based Table Detection".
